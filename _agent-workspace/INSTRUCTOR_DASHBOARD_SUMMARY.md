- Set proficiency targets
- Track completion and progress
- Automated notifications

### 5. Communication Center
- Direct messaging to students
- Class-wide announcements
- Notification system
- Message history and drafts

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State**: Zustand with persistence
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
