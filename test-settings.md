# Settings Persistence Test Plan

## Fixed Issues

✅ **Privacy Settings Page (`/profile/privacy`)**
- **Before**: Required manual save button click, settings would reset on navigation
- **After**: Automatic save on toggle, settings persist immediately via Zustand store

✅ **Notification Settings Page (`/profile/notifications`)**
- **Before**: Required manual save button click, settings would reset on navigation
- **After**: Automatic save on toggle, settings persist immediately via Zustand store
- **Bonus**: Device settings (quiet hours, sound profile) now also persist

✅ **Department Settings Page (`/profile/department`)**
- **Before**: Required manual save button click, settings would reset on navigation
- **After**: Automatic save on toggle, settings persist immediately via Zustand store

✅ **Practice Reminders Page (`/profile/reminders`)**
- **Before**: Already worked correctly with localStorage
- **After**: Now uses centralized Zustand store for consistency

## Technical Implementation

### Centralized Settings Store
- All user settings now managed through Zustand store with persistence
- Settings automatically saved to localStorage via Zustand's persist middleware
- No more manual save buttons required
- Consistent UX across all settings pages

### Settings Structure
```typescript
interface UserSettings {
  privacy: PrivacySettings;
  notifications: NotificationSettings;
  department: DepartmentSettings;
  reminders: PracticeReminder[];
}
```

### Auto-Save Pattern
- Settings save immediately when changed
- Visual indicator shows "Settings are automatically saved when changed"
- Removed all manual save buttons
- No more `hasChanges` state tracking needed

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Privacy Settings (`/profile/privacy`)**
   - [ ] Toggle any privacy setting
   - [ ] Navigate away and back
   - [ ] Verify setting persists

2. **Notification Settings (`/profile/notifications`)**
   - [ ] Toggle notification preferences
   - [ ] Change quiet hours times
   - [ ] Change sound profile
   - [ ] Navigate away and back
   - [ ] Verify all settings persist

3. **Department Settings (`/profile/department`)**
   - [ ] Change requirement level
   - [ ] Toggle training modules
   - [ ] Enable/disable custom codes
   - [ ] Navigate away and back
   - [ ] Verify all settings persist

4. **Practice Reminders (`/profile/reminders`)**
   - [ ] Add new reminder
   - [ ] Toggle existing reminder on/off
   - [ ] Delete reminder
   - [ ] Navigate away and back
   - [ ] Verify changes persist

## Performance Benefits

- Eliminated localStorage calls scattered throughout components
- Centralized state management improves debugging
- Consistent persistence behavior across all settings
- Better TypeScript support with centralized types
- Removed redundant state management code

## User Experience Improvements

- ✅ No more confusing "Save" buttons
- ✅ Settings save immediately on change
- ✅ Clear visual feedback about auto-save
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all settings pages
- ✅ No more lost settings on navigation
- ✅ Better responsiveness (no manual save step)
